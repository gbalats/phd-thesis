%%% Abstract in English

Static analysis aims to achieve a deep understanding of program
behavior, by automatic reasoning that requires only the program's
source code and not any actual execution. To reach a truly deep level
of program understanding, static analysis techniques need to create an
abstraction of memory that covers all possible executions. Such
abstract models may quickly degenerate after losing essential
structural information about the memory objects they describe, due to
the use of specific programming idioms and language features, or
because of practical analysis limitations. In many cases, some of the
lost memory structure may be retrieved, though it requires complex
inference that takes advantage of indirect uses of types. Such
recovered structural information may greatly benefit static analysis.
